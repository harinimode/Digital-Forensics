Case Scenario: Digital Forensics Investigation Using the Digital Forensic Tool
Incident Overview
A financial organization detected anomalies in its security logs, raising concerns about unauthorized access and potential data tampering. Employees reported unusual modifications in critical financial documents, prompting an urgent forensic investigation.
This repository provides a powerful suite of tools for digital forensic investigations, enabling professionals to analyze digital evidence with precision.
üíª Usage Scenarios(**Python Code:forensic.py )
1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Forensic Disk Image
Use this tool to create an exact copy of a disk for forensic analysis:

sudo python forensic_tool.py --image /dev/sdb disk_image.img
This ensures that investigators can analyze the disk without altering the original data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying File Integrity
To generate and verify cryptographic hashes, use:

python forensic_tool.py --hash example.txt sha256
python forensic_tool.py --compare original.txt copy.txt sha256
This helps in detecting any unauthorized modifications in digital evidence.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Extracting Metadata from Files
Retrieve metadata such as file creation time, size, and last modification date:

python forensic_tool.py --meta document.pdf
Useful for tracking file manipulations and timestamps.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzing Log Files for Security Threats
Scan logs for potential security breaches, such as unauthorized access attempts:

python forensic_tool.py --log system.log
Helps identify anomalies in security logs and detect potential cyber threats.

üìú Legal & Ethical Considerations
This toolkit is intended for ethical forensic investigations and cybersecurity research. Users must ensure compliance with legal frameworks and organizational policies before conducting forensic activities.
