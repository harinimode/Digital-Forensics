üíª Usage Scenarios
1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Forensic Disk Image
Use this tool to create an exact copy of a disk for forensic analysis:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python forensic_tool.py --image /dev/sdb disk_image.img
This ensures that investigators can analyze the disk without altering the original data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying File Integrity

bash
Copy
Edit
python forensic_tool.py --hash example.txt sha256
python forensic_tool.py --compare original.txt copy.txt sha256
This helps in detecting any unauthorized modifications in digital evidence.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Extracting Metadata from Files
Retrieve metadata such as file creation time, size, and last modification date:

bash
Copy
Edit
python forensic_tool.py --meta document.pdf
Useful for tracking file manipulations and timestamps.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzing Log Files for Security Threats
Scan logs for potential security breaches, such as unauthorized access attempts:

bash
Copy
Edit
python forensic_tool.py --log system.log
Helps identify anomalies in security logs and detect potential cyber threats.
